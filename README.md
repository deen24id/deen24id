Hi, Din here! :wave: 

My full name is Imaduddin Haetami.
I manage 2 GitHub account [Deen24ID](https://github.com/deen24id) and [artidataio](https://github.com/artidataio).

For the longest time, I have been wanting to change my GitHub account name. 
I started my coding career as a data scientist.
I picked up artidataio handle which originates from Bahasa Indonesia which translates to *"the meaning of data"*.
Throughout that period, I work on big data projects such as http://apps.artidata.io/sg-routing/. 
My personal website also resembles the name http://artidata.io/.

Overtime, my interest divert.
I became what the industry labelled as *fullstack developer*.
My notable project during this period is an SAAS reporting platform https://middleboard.com/ and a company website https://southeastislands.com/.

I realize that the name artidataio is limiting on what I aspire to be.
However, as there are many projects associated to that account and things can get broken when you change your github name.
I decided to do my future coding projects on a new account https://github.com/deen24id, while maintaining old project on the old account https://github.com/artidataio.
The new name Deen24ID is using part of my name *Deen* and my favorite number *24*.

Rest assured, there is still fire on me to code, automate and build.ðŸ”¥
